# Metal Discovery App

API Capstone for a Metal music sub-genre discovery application

## The Idea

The idea behind this application was to create a way for users to broaden their taste in metal music or to learn about a
specific subgenre that they have never really listened to. The user has two options, the first option is the user can select 
a subgenre and receive information on the selected subgenre and playlists from YouTube to get a sample of how it sounds. 
The second option is to search for a specific band, by doing so, the user receives information on the searched band and the 
videos from YouTube to listen to their music.
